The terms **AI agent, AI assistant, and bot** are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings depending on their functionality and purpose.

> This place is dedicated to AI agents. They are autonomous and make decisions on their own.

### 1. AI Agent

- **Definition:** An AI agent is an autonomous system that perceives its environment, processes information, and takes actions to achieve specific goals.
- **Key Features:**
  - Can operate independently.
  - Uses sensors or data inputs to make decisions.
  - Often built with reinforcement learning or rule-based decision-making.
- **Examples:** Self-driving cars, robotic process automation (RPA) systems, game AI.

### 2. AI Assistant

- **Definition:** An AI assistant is a software application that helps users perform tasks using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
- **Key Features:**
  - Engages in human-like conversation.
  - Provides helpful responses, reminders, scheduling, etc.
  - Can integrate with apps and services (e.g., email, calendar, smart home).
- **Examples:** ChatGPT, Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa.

### 3. Bot

- **Definition:** A bot is a general term for a software program that performs automated tasks, often repetitive in nature.
- **Key Features:**
  - Can be rule-based or AI-powered.
  - Can interact via text, voice, or automated scripts.
  - Often used for customer service, social media automation, or data scraping.
- **Examples:** Chatbots (e.g., customer service bots), trading bots, web crawlers.

## Key Differences

| Feature         | AI Agent      | AI Assistant | Bot |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Autonomy** | Fully autonomous | Partially autonomous (assists user) | Usually follows set rules |
| **Interaction** | Can act on its own in an environment | Responds to user queries | May not require human interaction |
| **Purpose** | Decision-making, problem-solving | Helping users with tasks | Automating repetitive tasks |
| **Examples** | Self-driving cars, AI in games | Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT | Customer service chatbots, trading bots |

## Summary

- **AI Agents** are more autonomous and can make complex decisions.  
- **AI Assistants** focus on user interaction and task assistance.  
- **Bots** are a broad category, often rule-based and used for automation.
